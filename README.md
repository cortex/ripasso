A simple password manager written in Rust.

The root crate `ripasso` is a library for accessing and decrypting passwords
stored in pass format (GPG-encrypted files), with a file-watcher event emitter.

Multiple UI's in different stages of development are available in subcrates.

To build all UI's:
```
cargo build --all
```

PR's are very welcome!

## History
This is a reimplementation of https://github.com/cortex/gopass in Rust. I started it mainly because https://github.com/go-qml/qml
is unmaintained. Also, using a safe language for your passwords seems like a good idea.

## UI's

### Cursive - Terminal interface

TUI interface based on [cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/Cursive)
Supports password age display and password editing.
I use this as my daily password-manager.

#### Build
```
cargo build -p ripasso-cursive
```


### QT GUI - (unstable)
![Screenshot of ripasso-qt](doc/ripasso-qt.png)
This is mostly working, but needs updates.

#### Build

```
cargo build -p ripasso-qt
```
For it to run, you need to be in the qml directory.

```
cd qml
cargo run
```

### GTK GUI - (WIP)

```
cd gtk
cargo run

```
